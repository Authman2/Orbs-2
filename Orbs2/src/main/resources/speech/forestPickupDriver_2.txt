Hmm? Oh, you came back. I'm still trying to figure out how I'm gonna get out of this mess...
What? You got me some tools? Wow, that's great! Thank you! Now I can go pickup all that fire wood.
Hey, one more thing. If you see a guy chopping wood in the forest back there, just let him know that I'm on my way, I just got held up a bit.
Thanks again!
