Oh, hello there! It's been a long time!
I never got a chance to thank you for helping me retrieve my orbs. There's no telling what could have happened if they got into the wrong hands.
There is, however, another issue, though.
You see, the orbs have lost a lot of their energy due to their inactivity in recent weeks. The only way to use them now is to charge them up again.
