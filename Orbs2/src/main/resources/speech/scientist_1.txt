Oh, hello there! It's been a long time!
I never got a chance to thank you for helping me retrieve my orbs. There's no telling what could have happened if they got into the wrong hands...
But enough of the past, over the last few months I have been working on a new experiment using these orbs.
You see, the orbs have lost a lot of their energy due to their inactivity in recent weeks. The only way to use them now is to charge them up again.
