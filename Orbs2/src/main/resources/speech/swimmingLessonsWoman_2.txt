Hello, Welcome to the ACMY pool! 
If you already have a pool membership card, you may use our pool at your leisure. We also offer swimming lessons for those who are interested in learning.
Oh, so you're here for swimmming lessons? Wonderful! I'll just have to see your pool membership card.
... ... ... Perfect!
Now you must follow these steps if you want to learn how to swim:
1.) A series of key instructions will appear on the screen. You must click the corresponding arrow keys in the exact order that it is displayed.
2.) Remember, you will be timed for each trial. If you do not complete the trial in the given amount of time, it is deemed incorrect.
3.) Complete all 10 trials successfully to win.
Good Luck!
