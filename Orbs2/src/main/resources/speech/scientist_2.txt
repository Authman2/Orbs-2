You'll recharge all of my orbs, won't you?
You will? Thank you very much, I knew I could trust you!
Remember, there are 10 orbs that need to be charged and 10 different charging stations.
You must take each orb to the charging station and run the accelerator. Once you have recharged all of the orbs, please return them to me.
Good luck!
