Hey man, thanks for restarting that generator! The whole town owes you a big thank you.
You seem to be very good at handling that thing. How would you like a job here?
No? Are you sure? Alright then. But I still think you've got some potential doing this kind of work.
If you ever change your mind I'll be here. Here, why don't I give you this, just in case you ever find yourself in a similar situation.
