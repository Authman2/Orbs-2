Hello again. Did you ever run into a guy driving a large truck to pickup some logs?
Really, you did? What did he say? Where is he?
Hmm, car trouble... On his way... Alright, sounds good! Thanks for delivering that message!
* Phew * I guess that means I can stop chopping wood for today.
Hey, you wanna give it a try? It can be kinda fun sometimes! Here, you take this and try it for yourself.
