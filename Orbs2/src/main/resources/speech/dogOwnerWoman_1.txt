Excuse me, sir, have you seen a golden retriever around here anywhere? A woman brought him here earlier so I could look after him for the day, but I haven't been able to find him anywhere in the last few hours!
Today has been busier than usual, and I guess with so many dogs to look after I must have lost track of one of them.
If I don't find that dog I could lose my business!
Please help me find him. Remember, if you see a small, golden retriever around please bring him back to me!
