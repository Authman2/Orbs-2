Are you here to pick up these logs? Oh, you're not? Sorry for bothering you.
I'm waiting here for someone to come and pick up all this chopped wood. A guy was supposed to be here with his truck half an hour ago and I can't seem to get in touch with him.
Well, if you see him, just let him know that I'm still waiting here for him.
