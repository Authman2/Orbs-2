Oh no... no, no, no... My business is ruined... How am I going to explain this...
Huh? What do you want? Can't you see I'm dealing with a crisis here?
* Sigh * I'm sorry, I'm just very worried.
You see, an employee from my oil company accidently dropped a few crates of oil into the ocean! We're on thin ice as it is, and now we need to figure out a way to clean up the oil before anyone notices.
There is this new experimental technology that is supposed to make cleaning up these kinds of messes very easy, but we would still need time to implement it.
And with everyone at the beach, there is almost never a time when there would not be anyone around.
Unless... Sir, this is a big task to ask of you, but would you be able to distract the townspeople just long enough for us to try our new cleanup method?
It will only take a few minutes, and I'd be happy to reward you generously for doing this. So what do you say?
You'll do it? Thank you! Now please, we have to work fast!
