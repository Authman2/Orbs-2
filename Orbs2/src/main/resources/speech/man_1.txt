I wish I knew how to swim so I could get across the river quickly. I wanted to check out a store in the East, but it will take too long to get there on foot.
I wonder if anyone has a boat that I could borrow... Hmm, maybe I'll just have to pay for swimming lessons somewhere.
I don't want to spend all of my money though. I guess I'll have to get a job.
Ugh! So much work just to visit one store!
