Hello, sir! What can I get for you today? In case you didn't see the sign outside, we are having a sale on ropes, tents, and other camping supplies. So, what'll it be?
Oh, so you would like to buy one rope? Sounds good, that'll be 20 coins.
Hold on a minute, it looks like you don't have enough money to purchase this item right now. Please come back when you have 20 coins.
