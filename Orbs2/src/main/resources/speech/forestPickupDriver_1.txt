Hey man, you wouldn't happen to have a cell phone with you, right?
No? That's too bad. My truck broke down and I my cell phone is out of battery. I can't call my mechanic to come and fix my truck.
I could even fix it myself, I just need the right tools. I can't leave my truck unattended, though. I'll have to figure out someway to get help...
