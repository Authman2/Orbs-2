Hey kid! I need some help over here. You see, the power got knocked out all of town because of a malfunction with a generator on the other end of the power plant. To turn the power back on someone needs to start moving the generator again.
Now here's the problem: I started messing around with some of these wires and was able to bring some of the power back in parts of the factory by just holding them together in this position.
I can't leave these wires to restart the generator or else the power situation might become worse. For all I know it could cut off the power somewhere else, too.
Would you please do me a favor and restart the generator while I hold these wires together?
You will? Great! But remember, some parts of the factory are password protected to keep criminals out. You'll have to answer some questions to open the doors.
You seem like a smart kid though. I'm sure you'll be able to get them open.
