Ok, so I got streamers, balloons, and presents... What am I forgetting?
... ... ...
What was that? Oh I'm sorry I didn't see you there. I'm trying to setup the house for my daugther's birthday party.
I can't help feeling like I am forgetting something though... Can you help?
Hmm? Streamers? Got it.
Balloons? Got it.
Presents? Got it.
Snacks?
......
Oh no! I can't believe I forgot to get snacks! What am I going to do now?
What's that? You can pick some up for me? That would be wonderful!
Please come back as soon as you can, the party starts at 3:30!
